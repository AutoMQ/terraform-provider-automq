# automq_kafka_instance (Data Source)

![Preview](https://img.shields.io/badge/Lifecycle_Stage-Preview-blue?style=flat&logoColor=8A3BE2&labelColor=rgba)<br><br>Using the `automq_kafka_instance` data source, you can manage kafka resoure within instance.

## Example Usage

```terraform
data "automq_kafka_instance" "example" {
  environment_id = var.automq_environment_id
  name           = "automq-example-1"
}

variable "automq_environment_id" {
  type = string
}

output "example-id" {
  value = data.automq_kafka_instance.example.id
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `environment_id` (String) Target AutoMQ BYOC environment, this attribute is specified during the deployment and installation process.

### Optional

- `id` (String) The ID of the Kafka instance.
- `name` (String) The name of the Kafka instance. It can contain letters (a-z or A-Z), numbers (0-9), underscores (_), and hyphens (-), with a length limit of 3 to 64 characters.

### Read-Only

- `acl` (Boolean) The ACL status the Kafka instance.
- `cloud_provider` (String) The cloud provider of kafka instance. Currently, `aws` is supported.
- `compute_specs` (Attributes) The compute specs of the instance, contains aku and version. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--compute_specs))
- `configs` (Map of String) Additional configuration for the Kafka Instance. The currently supported parameters can be set by referring to the [documentation](https://docs.automq.com/automq-cloud/using-automq-for-kafka/restrictions#instance-level-configuration).
- `created_at` (String)
- `description` (String) The instance description are used to differentiate the purpose of the instance. They support letters (a-z or A-Z), numbers (0-9), underscores (_), spaces( ) and hyphens (-), with a length limit of 3 to 128 characters.
- `endpoints` (Attributes List) The bootstrap endpoints of instance. AutoMQ supports multiple access protocols; therefore, the Endpoint is a list. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--endpoints))
- `integrations` (List of String) List of All Integrations Associated with the Current Instance. AutoMQ supports integration with external products like `prometheus` and `cloudWatch`, forwarding instance Metrics data to Prometheus and CloudWatch.
- `last_updated` (String)
- `networks` (Attributes List) The networks of the Kafka instance. Currently, you can get one availability zone or three availability zones. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--networks))
- `region` (String) The region of the Kafka instance
- `status` (String) The status of instance. Currently supports statuses: `Creating`, `Running`, `Deleting`, `Changing` and `Abnormal`. For definitions and limitations of each status, please refer to the [documentation](https://docs.automq.com/automq-cloud/using-automq-for-kafka/manage-instances#lifecycle).

### Nested Schema for `compute_specs`

Read-Only:

- `aku` (Number) AutoMQ defines AKU (AutoMQ Kafka Unit) to measure the scale of the cluster. Each AKU provides 20 MiB/s of read/write throughput. For more details on AKU, please refer to the [documentation](https://docs.automq.com/automq-cloud/subscriptions-and-billings/byoc-env-billings/billing-instructions-for-byoc).
- `version` (String) The software version of AutoMQ instance.


<a id="nestedatt--endpoints"></a>
### Nested Schema for `endpoints`

Read-Only:

- `bootstrap_servers` (String) The bootstrap servers of the endpoint.
- `display_name` (String) The name of the endpoint
- `mechanisms` (String) The supported mechanisms of endpoint. Currently support `PLAIN`, `SCRAM-SHA-256`, `SCRAM-SHA-512`.
- `network_type` (String) The network type of endpoint. Currently support `VPC` and `INTERNET`. `VPC` type is generally used for internal network access, while `INTERNET` type is used for accessing the AutoMQ cluster from the internet.
- `protocol` (String) The protocol of endpoint. Currently support `PLAINTEXT` and `SASL_PLAINTEXT`.


<a id="nestedatt--networks"></a>
### Nested Schema for `networks`

Read-Only:

- `subnets` (List of String) The subnets under the corresponding availability zone for deploying the instance. Currently, only one subnet can be set for each availability zone.
- `zone` (String) The availability zone ID of the cloud provider.
