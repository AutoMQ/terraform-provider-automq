# automq_kafka_instance (Resource)

![General_Availability](https://img.shields.io/badge/Lifecycle_Stage-General_Availability(GA)-green?style=flat&logoColor=8A3BE2&labelColor=rgba)<br><br>Using the `automq_kafka_instance` resource type, you can create and manage Kafka instances, where each instance represents a physical cluster.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "automq_kafka_instance" "example" {
  environment_id = "env-example"
  name           = "automq-example-1"
  description    = "example"
  cloud_provider = "aws"
  region         = local.instance_deploy_region
  networks = [
    {
      zone    = var.instance_deploy_zone
      subnets = [var.instance_deploy_subnet]
    }
  ]
  compute_specs = {
    aku = "6"
  }
  acl = true
  configs = {
    "auto.create.topics.enable" = "false"
    "log.retention.ms"          = "3600000"
  }
}

variable "instance_deploy_zone" {
  type = string
}

variable "instance_deploy_subnet" {
  type = string
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `compute_specs` (Attributes) The compute specs of the instance (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--compute_specs))
- `deploy_profile` (String)
- `environment_id` (String) Target AutoMQ BYOC environment, this attribute is specified during the deployment and installation process.
- `features` (Attributes) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--features))
- `name` (String) The name of the Kafka instance. It can contain letters (a-z or A-Z), numbers (0-9), underscores (_), and hyphens (-), with a length limit of 3 to 64 characters.

### Optional

- `description` (String) The instance description are used to differentiate the purpose of the instance. They support letters (a-z or A-Z), numbers (0-9), underscores (_), spaces( ) and hyphens (-), with a length limit of 3 to 128 characters.
- `timeouts` (Block, Optional) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--timeouts))
- `version` (String) The software version of AutoMQ instance. By default, there is no need to set version; the latest version will be used. If you need to specify a version, refer to the [documentation](https://docs.automq.com/automq-cloud/release-notes) to choose the appropriate version number.

### Read-Only

- `created_at` (String)
- `endpoints` (Attributes List) The bootstrap endpoints of instance. AutoMQ supports multiple access protocols; therefore, the Endpoint is a list. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--endpoints))
- `id` (String) The ID of the Kafka instance.
- `last_updated` (String)
- `status` (String) The status of instance. Currently supports statuses: `Creating`, `Running`, `Deleting`, `Changing` and `Abnormal`. For definitions and limitations of each status, please refer to the [documentation](https://docs.automq.com/automq-cloud/using-automq-for-kafka/manage-instances#lifecycle).

### Nested Schema for `compute_specs`

Required:

- `bucket_profiles` (Attributes List) Bucket profiles configuration (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--compute_specs--bucket_profiles))
- `networks` (Attributes List) To configure the network settings for an instance, you need to specify the availability zone(s) and subnet information. Currently, you can set either one availability zone or three availability zones. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--compute_specs--networks))
- `reserved_aku` (Number) AutoMQ defines AKU (AutoMQ Kafka Unit) to measure the scale of the cluster. Each AKU provides 20 MiB/s of read/write throughput. For more details on AKU, please refer to the [documentation](https://docs.automq.com/automq-cloud/subscriptions-and-billings/byoc-env-billings/billing-instructions-for-byoc#indicator-constraints). The currently supported AKU specifications are 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, and 24. If an invalid AKU value is set, the instance cannot be created.

Optional:

- `kubernetes_node_groups` (Attributes List) Kubernetes node groups configuration (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--compute_specs--kubernetes_node_groups))

<a id="nestedatt--compute_specs--bucket_profiles"></a>
### Nested Schema for `compute_specs.bucket_profiles`

Required:

- `id` (String) Bucket profile ID


<a id="nestedatt--compute_specs--networks"></a>
### Nested Schema for `compute_specs.networks`

Required:

- `subnets` (List of String) Specify the subnet under the corresponding availability zone for deploying the instance. Currently, only one subnet can be set for each availability zone.
- `zone` (String) The availability zone ID of the cloud provider.


<a id="nestedatt--compute_specs--kubernetes_node_groups"></a>
### Nested Schema for `compute_specs.kubernetes_node_groups`

Required:

- `id` (String) Node group ID

### Nested Schema for `features`

Required:

- `security` (Attributes) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--features--security))

Optional:

- `instance_configs` (Map of String) Additional configuration for the Kafka Instance. The currently supported parameters can be set by referring to the [documentation](https://docs.automq.com/automq-cloud/using-automq-for-kafka/restrictions#instance-level-configuration).
- `integrations` (Attributes List) Integration configurations (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--features--integrations))

<a id="nestedatt--features--security"></a>
### Nested Schema for `features.security`

### Nested Schema for `timeouts`

Optional:

- `create` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).
- `delete` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Setting a timeout for a Delete operation is only applicable if changes are saved into state before the destroy operation occurs.
