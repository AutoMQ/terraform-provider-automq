# automq_kafka_instance (Resource)

![Preview](https://img.shields.io/badge/Lifecycle_Stage-Preview-blue?style=flat&logoColor=8A3BE2&labelColor=rgba)<br><br>Using the `automq_kafka_instance` resource type, you can create and manage Kafka instances, where each instance represents a physical cluster.

## Example Usage

```terraform
data "automq_deploy_profile" "default" {
  environment_id = "env-example"
  name           = "default"
}

resource "automq_kafka_instance" "test" {
  environment_id = "env-example"
  name           = "example-1"
  description    = "example"
  deploy_profile = data.automq_deploy_profile.default.name
  version        = "1.4.0"

  compute_specs = {
    reserved_aku = 6
    networks = [
      {
        zone    = "us-east-1a"
        subnets = ["subnet-xxxxxx"]
      }
    ]
    bucket_profiles = [
      {
        id = data.automq_deploy_profile.default.data_buckets.0.id
      }
    ]
  }

  features = {
    wal_mode = "EBSWAL"
    security = {
      authentication_methods   = ["anonymous"]
      transit_encryption_modes = ["plaintext"]
    }
  }
}

variable "instance_deploy_zone" {
  type = string
}

variable "instance_deploy_subnet" {
  type = string
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `compute_specs` (Attributes) The compute specs of the instance (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--compute_specs))
- `deploy_profile` (String)
- `environment_id` (String) Target AutoMQ BYOC environment, this attribute is specified during the deployment and installation process.
- `features` (Attributes) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--features))
- `name` (String) The name of the Kafka instance. It can contain letters (a-z or A-Z), numbers (0-9), underscores (_), and hyphens (-), with a length limit of 3 to 64 characters.
- `version` (String) The software version of AutoMQ instance. If you need to specify a version, refer to the [documentation](https://docs.automq.com/automq-cloud/release-notes) to choose the appropriate version number.

### Optional

- `description` (String) The instance description are used to differentiate the purpose of the instance. They support letters (a-z or A-Z), numbers (0-9), underscores (_), spaces( ) and hyphens (-), with a length limit of 3 to 128 characters.
- `timeouts` (Block, Optional) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--timeouts))

### Read-Only

- `created_at` (String)
- `endpoints` (Attributes List) The bootstrap endpoints of instance. AutoMQ supports multiple access protocols; therefore, the Endpoint is a list. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--endpoints))
- `id` (String) The ID of the Kafka instance.
- `last_updated` (String)
- `status` (String) The status of instance. Currently supports statuses: `Creating`, `Running`, `Deleting`, `Changing` and `Abnormal`. For definitions and limitations of each status, please refer to the [documentation](https://docs.automq.com/automq-cloud/using-automq-for-kafka/manage-instances#lifecycle).

### Nested Schema for `compute_specs`

Required:

- `bucket_profiles` (Attributes List) Bucket profiles configuration (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--compute_specs--bucket_profiles))
- `reserved_aku` (Number) AutoMQ defines AKU (AutoMQ Kafka Unit) to measure the scale of the cluster. Each AKU provides 20 MiB/s of read/write throughput. For more details on AKU, please refer to the [documentation](https://docs.automq.com/automq-cloud/subscriptions-and-billings/byoc-env-billings/billing-instructions-for-byoc#indicator-constraints). The currently supported AKU specifications are 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, and 24. If an invalid AKU value is set, the instance cannot be created.

Optional:

- `kubernetes_node_groups` (Attributes List) Kubernetes node groups configuration (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--compute_specs--kubernetes_node_groups))
- `networks` (Attributes List) To configure the network settings for an instance, you need to specify the availability zone(s) and subnet information. Currently, you can set either one availability zone or three availability zones. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--compute_specs--networks))

<a id="nestedatt--compute_specs--networks"></a>
### Nested Schema for `compute_specs.networks`

Required:

- `subnets` (List of String) Specify the subnet under the corresponding availability zone for deploying the instance. Currently, only one subnet can be set for each availability zone.

<a id="nestedblock--timeouts"></a>
### Nested Schema for `timeouts`

Optional:

- `create` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).
- `delete` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Setting a timeout for a Delete operation is only applicable if changes are saved into state before the destroy operation occurs.
