## Schema

### Required

- `kafka_instance_id` (String) Target Kafka instance ID, each instance represents a kafka cluster. The instance id looks like kf-xxxxxxx.
- `operation_group` (String) Set the authorized operation group. For the Topic resource type, the supported operations are `ALL (all permissions)`, `PRODUCE (produce messages only)`, and `CONSUME (consume messages only)`. For other resource types, only `ALL (all permissions)` is supported.
- `pattern_type` (String) Set the resource name matching pattern, supporting `LITERAL` and `PREFIXED`. `LITERAL` represents exact matching, while `PREFIXED` represents prefix matching.
- `principal` (String) Set the authorized target principal, which currently supports Kafka User type principals, i.e., User:xxxx. Specify the Kafka user name. Principal must start with `User:` and contact with kafka_username.
- `resource_name` (String) The target resource name for Kafka ACL authorization, can be a specific resource name or a resource name prefix (when using prefix matching, only the prefix needs to be provided without ending with "\*"). If only "\*" is specified, it represents all resources.
- `resource_type` (String) The Kafka ACL authorized resource types, currently support `CLUSTER`, `TOPIC`, `CONSUMERGROUP` and `TRANSACTION_ID`.

### Optional

- `environment_id` (String) Target AutoMQ BYOC environment, this attribute is specified during the deployment and installation process.
- `permission` (String) Set the permission type, which supports `ALLOW` and `DENY`. `ALLOW` grants permission to perform the operation, while `DENY` prohibits the operation. `DENY` takes precedence over `ALLOW`.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The Kafka ACL Resource ID is returned upon successful creation of the ACL.
