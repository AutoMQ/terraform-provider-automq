## Prerequisites

The AutoMQ environment represents a namespace, with each environment containing a complete set of AutoMQ control plane and data plane. All control and data planes of the AutoMQ BYOC environment are deployed within the user's VPC to ensure data privacy and security.

The AutoMQ Provider is used to manage an already installed AutoMQ environment. Therefore, before using the AutoMQ Provider, you need to complete the environment installation and obtain the access point and initial account information.

Refer to the following for specific operations:
- Install the AutoMQ environment by following the [documentation](https://registry.terraform.io/modules/AutoMQ/automq-byoc-environmet/aws/latest).
- Create a ServiceAccount and obtain an AccessKey: After the environment is installed, users need to access the AutoMQ environment console through web browser, create a Service Account, and use the Access Key of the Service Account. Please refer to [document](https://docs.automq.com/automq-cloud/manage-identities-and-access/service-accounts).
